"Not good enough" says the voice in your head.

Not good enough for what? For who? 

You don't bother to ask.

You had an idea that excited you. Delighted you. 

Now it's worthless. 

It won't be successful. 

It just won't work. Why did you even think it would?

~

Years later you see someone else do it.

"I thought of that first!" says that same voice.

"My idea was better! This just scrapes the surface of what I imagined!"

Now your idea is great again. The best! World changing.

You're kicking yourself for giving up on it.

"This sucks"

You start to feel bitter. 

You resent this other person. 

This person who did what you decided not to do. 

You pick apart every little flaw in their work. 

"I can't believe people like it"

They made your idea bad. But you, you would've turned your idea into something great. Something amazing.

"I could've made something much better than this!"

But you didn't do something better.

You didn't do anything.

~

There's a alternative reality where you didn't talk yourself out of your idea. What you did turned into a great success.

There's another alternative reality where you didn't talk yourself out of you idea and it was a spectactular failure.

In both those realities you learned many things. 

You learned what works and what doesn't. You learned what you're capabale of and how far you still need to go. 

The things that bring you closer and closer to success, whether your idea worked or not.

You got new skills, new experience, new relationships. 

~

In this reality you learned just one thing.

That you talked yourself out of success.
